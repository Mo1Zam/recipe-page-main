## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Meadia Query


### What I learned

In this challenge i have learned Media query how to use it in a right way.

code snippets, see below:

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 390px ){
    .main-container{
        width: 75%;
        margin: 3dvh auto 10dvh;
        padding: 8vw;
    }
    .main-container li{
        margin-left: -2dvh;
    }
    .main-container div,p{
        margin-bottom: 4%;
    }

    .attribution{
        height: 8dvh;
    }
    .prepration-contents li{
        margin-left: -1vw;
    }
    .ingredients-contents li{
        margin-left: -1;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Looking forward to create a fully functional website with Javascript.


### Useful resources
